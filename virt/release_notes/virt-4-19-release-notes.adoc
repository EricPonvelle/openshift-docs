//=== Documentation improvements


[id="virt-4-19-notable-technical-changes_{context}"]
=== Notable technical changes

// CNV-48243: RN - Support declarative VirtualMachine management with instance types
* VirtualMachines that use instance types and preferences no longer have their specification mutated at runtime to include derived metadata, such as `revisionName`. This metadata is now stored in the `status` field to preserve the declarative VM specification and ensure compatibility.

//CNV-57108
* In {VirtProductName} 4.19, the default permissions for live migration have changed to improve cluster security. Users must now be explicitly granted the `kubevirt.io:migrate` xref:../../virt/about_virt/virt-security-policies.adoc#default-cluster-roles-for-virt_virt-security-policies[cluster role] to create, delete, or update live migration requests. Previously, namespace administrators had these permissions by default. For more information, see xref:../../virt/live_migration/virt-about-live-migration.adoc#virt-about-live-migration-permissions_virt-about-live-migration[About live migration permissions].

//CNV-38746
* When you update from {product-title} 4.12 to a newer minor version, VMs that use the `cnv-bridge` Container Network Interface (CNI) fail to live migrate. (link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7069807[])
** As a workaround, change the `spec.config.type` field in your `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` manifest from `cnv-bridge` to `bridge` before performing the update.

==== Storage

//CNV-61279: 4.19 - Storage Migrate VM with MTC
* Restoring a snapshot of a virtual machine (VM) migrated using Migration Toolkit for Containers (MTC) fails. The restore creates a persistent volume claim (PVC) but not a data volume (DV). The VM spec references a `DataVolumeTemplate` missing from the `volumes` list. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-61279[*CNV-61279*])
** As a workaround, restart the VM after storage migration and before taking the snapshot. This creates a new controller revision that avoids the issue.

// CNV-55104: 4.18 - Unresolved
* If you perform storage class migration for a stopped VM, the VM might not be able to start because of a missing bootable device. To prevent this, do not attempt storage class migration if the VM is not running. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-55104[*CNV-55104*])

//CNV-33835: 4.16 - Unresolved
* {VirtProductName} links a service account token in use by a pod to that specific pod. {VirtProductName} implements a service account volume by creating a disk image that contains a token. If you migrate a VM, then the service account volume becomes invalid. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-33835[*CNV-33835*])
** As a workaround, use user accounts rather than service accounts because user account tokens are not bound to a specific pod.

//CNV-36448
* When adding a virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) device to a Windows VM, the BitLocker Drive Encryption system check passes even if the vTPM device is not persistent. This is because a vTPM device that is not persistent stores and recovers encryption keys using ephemeral storage for the lifetime of the virt-launcher pod. When the VM migrates or is shut down and restarts, the vTPM data is lost. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-36448[CNV-36448])

:FeatureName: Using {VirtProductName} in a cluster deployed on s390x architecture
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]
:!FeatureName:
endif::[]

// cnv-61740 - s390x VM fails to boot with SATA CD-ROM
* If you create a VM from a template and select *Boot from CD*, the VM fails to boot and the error `unsupported configuration: SATA is not supported with this QEMU binary` is logged. This occurs because the CD-ROM is automatically mounted as a SATA device, which is not supported on s390x architecture. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-61740[CNV-61740])
** As a workaround, navigate to the VM's *Configuration* ->  *Storage* tab, select the CD-ROM, and change the interface type from *SATA* to *SCSI*.

// cnv-61957 - GPU devices should not be shown in UI
* GPU devices appear in the *Hardware Devices* list for s390x VMs, but GPU support is not available for s390x architecture. You can disregard these list entries. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-61957[CNV-61957])

// ocpbugs-51113 - ballooning call traces
* When you create a VM by using {op-system-base-full} container disk images for s390x architecture, call traces referencing `virtio_balloon` free page reporting print to the VM console. This is due to a kernel bug. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-51113[OCPBUGS-51113])
** As a workaround, disable memory ballooning for the VM by adding the following parameter to the VM YAML configuration: `spec.domain.devices.autoattachMemBalloon: false`.
+
You can also disable free page reporting of memory ballooning for all new VMs. To do so, edit the `HyperConverged` CR and add the parameter `spec.virtualMachineOptions.disableFreePageReporting: true`.

// cnv-56889 - boot mode
* VMs based on s390x architecture can only use the *IPL* boot mode. However, in the {product-title} web console, the *Boot mode* list for s390x VMs incorrectly includes *BIOS*, *UEFI*, and *UEFI (secure)* boot modes. If you select one of these modes for an s390x-based VM, the operation fails. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-56889[CNV-56889])

// cnv-56890 - threads
* In the {product-title} web console, it is erroneously possible to define multiple CPU threads for a VM based on s390x architecture. If you define multiple CPU threads, the VM enters a `CrashLoopBackOff` state with the `qemu-kvm: S390 does not support more than 1 threads` error. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-56890[CNV-56890])

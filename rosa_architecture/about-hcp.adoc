//IMPORTANT!!!
//This page includes information from "Understanding ROSA" (rosa-architecture-rosa-understanding) and "What is ROSA" (cloud-experts-getting-started-what-is-rosa). I have intentionally deleted those two modules from the HCP topic map in an effort to condense our introductory materials.

{product-title} is a fully-managed turnkey application platform that allows you to focus on what matters most, delivering value to your customers by building and deploying applications. Red{nbsp}Hat and AWS SRE experts manage the underlying platform so you do not have to worry about infrastructure management. {product-title} provides seamless integration with a wide range of AWS compute, database, analytics, machine learning, networking, mobile, AI and other services to further accelerate the building and delivering of differentiating experiences to your customers.

{product-title} offers a reduced-cost solution to create a managed {product-title} cluster with a focus on efficiency and security. You can quickly create a new cluster and deploy applications in minutes.

You subscribe to the service directly from your AWS account. After you create clusters, you can operate your clusters with the OpenShift web console, the `rosa` CLI, or through {cluster-manager-first}.

You receive OpenShift updates with new feature releases and a shared, common source for alignment with OpenShift Container Platform. {product-title} supports the same versions of OpenShift as Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Container Platform to achieve version consistency.

{product-title} uses AWS Security Token Service (STS) with AWS IAM to obtain credentials to manage infrastructure in your AWS account. AWS STS is a global web service that creates temporary credentials for IAM users/roles or federated users/roles. {product-title} uses this to assign short-term, limited-privilege, security credentials. These credentials are associated with IAM roles that are specific to each component that makes AWS API calls. This method aligns with the principals of least privilege and secure practices in cloud service resource management. The ROSA command-line interface (CLI) tool manages the STS credentials that are assigned for unique tasks and takes action on AWS resources as part of OpenShift functionality. For a more detailed explanation, see xref:../rosa_architecture/cloud-experts-rosa-hcp-sts-explained.adoc#cloud-experts-rosa-hcp-sts-explained[AWS STS and {product-title} explained].

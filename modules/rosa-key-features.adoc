= Key features of {product-title}

* *Cluster node scaling:* {product-title} requires a minimum of only two nodes, making it ideal for smaller projects while still being able to scale to support larger projects and enterprises. Easily add or remove compute nodes to match resource demand. Autoscaling allows you to automatically adjust the size of the cluster based on the current workload. See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_service_on_aws/4/html/cluster_administration/rosa-cluster-autoscaling-hcp[About autoscaling nodes on a cluster] for more details.

* *Fully managed underlying control plane infrastructure:* Control plane components, such as the API server and etcd database, are hosted in a Red{nbsp}Hat-owned AWS account.
* *Rapid provisioning time:* Provisioning time is approximately 10 minutes.
* *Continued cluster operation during upgrades:* Customers can upgrade the control plane and machine pools separately, ensuring the cluster remains operational during the upgrade process.
* *Native AWS service:* Access and use Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift on-demand with a self-service onboarding experience through the AWS management console.
* *Flexible, consumption-based pricing:* Scale to your business needs and pay as you go with flexible pricing and an on-demand hourly or annual billing model.
* *Single bill for Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift and AWS usage:* Customers will receive a single bill from AWS for both Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift and AWS consumption.
* *Fully integrated support experience:* Management, maintenance, and upgrades are performed by Red{nbsp}Hat site reliability engineers (SREs) with joint Red{nbsp}Hat and Amazon support and a 99.95% service-level agreement (SLA). See the link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_service_on_aws/4/html/support/getting-support#getting-support[{product-title} support documentation] for more details.
* *AWS service integration:* AWS has a robust portfolio of cloud services, such as compute, storage, networking, database, analytics, Virtualization and AI. All of these services are directly accessible through {product-title}. This makes it easier to build, operate, and scale globally and on-demand through a familiar management interface.
* *Maximum availability:* Deploy clusters across multiple availability zones in supported regions to maximize availability and maintain high availability for your most demanding mission-critical applications and data.
* *Optimized clusters:* Choose from memory-optimized, compute-optimized, general purpose, or accelerated EC2 instance types with clusters to meet your needs.
* *Global availability:* Refer to the link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_service_on_aws/4/html/introduction_to_rosa/policies-and-service-definition#rosa-sdpolicy-regions-az_rosa-hcp-service-definition[product regional availability page] to see where {product-title} is available globally.

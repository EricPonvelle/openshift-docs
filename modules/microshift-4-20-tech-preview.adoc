== Generic Device Plugin feature

The Generic Device Plugin (GDP) is a Kubernetes device plugin that enables applications running in pods to access host devices such as serial ports, cameras, and sound cards securely. This Technology Preview capability is especially important for edge and IoT environments where direct hardware interaction is a common requirement. The GDP integrates with the kubelet to advertise available devices to the node and facilitate their allocation to pods without requiring elevated privileges within the container itself.

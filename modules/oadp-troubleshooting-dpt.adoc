|===
|Error |Reason |Solution

| DPT stuck in `InProgress` state | Bucket credentials or bucket access failure | Check `Secret` object, bucket permissions, and logs.
| Upload test failed | Incorrect `Secret` object or S3 endpoint | Check the `BackupStorageLocation` object config and the access keys.
| Snapshot tests fail | Incorrect configuration of CSI snapshot controller | Check the `VolumeSnapshotClass` object availability and the CSI driver logs.
| Bucket encryption or versioning not populated | Cloud provider limitations | Not all object storage providers expose these fields consistently.

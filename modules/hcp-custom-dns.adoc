= Defining a custom DNS name

As a cluster administrator, you can create a hosted cluster with an external API DNS name that is different from the internal endpoint that is used for node bootstraps and control plane communication. You might want to define a different DNS name for the following reasons:

* To replace the user-facing TLS certificate with one from a public CA without breaking the control plane functions that are bound to the internal root CA
* To support split-horizon DNS and NAT scenarios
* To ensure a similar experience to standalone control planes, where you can use functions, such as the "Show Login Command" function, with the correct `kubeconfig` and DNS configuration

You can define a DNS name either during your initial setup or during day-2 operations, by entering a domain name in the `kubeAPIServerDNSName` field of a `HostedCluster` object.

.Prerequisites

* You have a valid TLS certificate that covers the DNS name that you will set in the `kubeAPIServerDNSName` field.
* Your DNS name is a resolvable URI that is reachable and pointing to the right address.

.Procedure

* In the specification for the `HostedCluster` object, add the `kubeAPIServerDNSName` field and the address for the domain and specify which certificate to use, as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
#...
spec:
  configuration:
    apiServer:
      servingCerts:
        namedCertificates:
        - names:
          - xxx.example.com
          - yyy.example.com
          servingCertificate:
            name: <my_serving_certificate>
  kubeAPIServerDNSName: <your_custom_address> # <1>
----
+
<1> The value for the `kubeAPIServerDNSName` field must be a valid, addressable domain.

After you define the `kubeAPIServerDNSName` field and specify the certificate, the Control Plane Operator controllers create a `kubeconfig` file named `custom-admin-kubeconfig`, which is stored in the `HostedControlPlane` namespace. The certificates are generated from the root CA, and the `HostedControlPlane` namespace manages their expiration and renewal.

The Control Plane Operator reports a new `kubeconfig` file named `CustomKubeconfig` in the `HostedControlPlane` namespace. That file uses the new server that is defined in the `kubeAPIServerDNSName` field.

The custom `kubeconfig` file is referenced in the `HostedCluster` object in the `status` field as `CustomKubeconfig`. The `CustomKubeConfig` field is optional, and can be added only if the `kubeAPIServerDNSName` field is not empty. When the `CustomKubeConfig` field is set, it triggers the generation of a secret named `<hosted_cluster_name>-custom-admin-kubeconfig` in the `HostedCluster` namespace. You can use the secret to access the `HostedCluster` API server. If you remove the `CustomKubeConfig` field during day-2 operations, all related secrets and status references are deleted.

[NOTE]
====
This process does not directly affect the data plane, so no rollouts are expected to occur. The `HostedControlPlane` namespace receives the changes from the HyperShift Operator and deletes the corresponding fields.
====

If you remove the `kubeAPIServerDNSName` field from the specification for the `HostedCluster` object, all newly generated secrets and the `CustomKubeconfig` reference are removed from the cluster and from the `status` field.

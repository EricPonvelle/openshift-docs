[role="_abstract"]
This release includes many fixes for bugs.

* Before this update, embedding container images into a bootc build could fail because HTTP proxy environment variables were defined in the bootc image. Proxy errors occurred during container image embedding and prevented successful builds. With this release, the bootc image no longer sets HTTP proxy environment variables, thereby eliminating the issue. As a result, you can now embed container images without encountering proxy errors. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-61433[OCPBUGS-61433])

* Before this update, a bare-metal node reboot caused the deployment progress deadline to be surpassed. This resulted in the greenboot health check failing with a false-positive error. With this release, the `ProgressDeadlineExceeded` condition for deployments is removed to allow time for reboots that exceed the default time limit. Now, the full timeout duration is provided for the deployment to become ready, reducing false-positive greenboot health check errors. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-59175[OCPBUGS-59175])

* Before this update, duplicated dependencies and firewall configurations were included in blueprints. This update streamlines blueprint installation by eliminating unnecessary packages and firewall configurations, enhancing efficiency. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-55818[OCPBUGS-55818])

* Before this update, the ROUTER_ENABLE_EXTERNAL_CERTIFICATE environment variable was not set by default, despite the Route `ExternalCertificate` feature being supported in {microshift-short}. Because of this, you could not configure routes with third-party certificate management solutions by using the `.spec.tls.externalCertificate` field of the route API. With this release, the environment variable value is set to `True` and the Route `ExternalCertificate` feature is enabled. You can reference externally managed TLS certificates through secrets, eliminating the need for manual certificate management. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-58357[OCPBUGS-58357])

* Before this update, the lack of an {OCP} pull-secret caused excessive telemetry collection failure logs. As a consequence, telemetry errors flooded the journald logs With this release, the telemetry pull secret error rate is reduced. As a result, telemetry collection messages no longer flood the logs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-57777[OCPBUGS-57777])

* In this release, the backend implementation of the observability YAML file is streamlined to prevent accidental overwriting of custom observability configuration when you update {microshift-short}. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-56157[OCPBUGS-56157])

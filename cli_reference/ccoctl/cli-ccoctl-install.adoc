The Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) manages cloud provider credentials as custom resource definitions (CRDs). The CCO syncs on CredentialsRequest custom resources (CRs) to allow {ocp} components to request cloud provider credentials with the specific permissions that are required for the cluster to run.

The {ccoctl} tool provides various commands to assist with the creating and maintenance of cloud credentials from outside the cluster when the CCO is put in "Manual" mode.

== Creating AWS resources with the Cloud Credential Operator utility

You have the following options when creating AWS resources:

* You can use the `ccoctl aws create-all` command to create the AWS resources automatically. This is the quickest way to create the resources. See xref:../../cli_reference/ccoctl/cli-ccoctl-install.adoc#cco-ccoctl-creating-at-once_cli-ccoctl-install[Creating AWS resources with a single command].

* If you need to review the JSON files that the `ccoctl` tool creates before modifying AWS resources, or if the process the `ccoctl` tool uses to create AWS resources automatically does not meet the requirements of your organization, you can create the AWS resources individually. See xref:../../cli_reference/ccoctl/cli-ccoctl-install.adoc#cco-ccoctl-creating-individually_cli-ccoctl-install[Creating AWS resources individually].
